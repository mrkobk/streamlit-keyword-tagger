		Clustering Keywords into larger buckets among a number of defined dimensions allows to uncover
		broader trends and visualise these more easily. This script is nothing more than a thought starter for those interested,
		taking a .xlsx file with 2 tabs as input
		
		- **Tab 1**: list or table. 1 column should contain a list of KW with a column header of "keyword".
		Additional columns with labels you may already have can be added
		
		- **Tab 2**: list or table of tags. Column header should be group (e.x. Gender, Products...). Values underneath should be characteristics (e.x. Men, Women's,)
		Make sure to also add plurals, term variations and/or synonyms you want to be found. In particular if you use the advanced feature of uploading your own map (see bottom of sidebar) 
		
		Output is a .csv file with the keywords being labelled. This happens based on a simple reverse-search labeling the keywords if the tag characteristic is present in the keywords
